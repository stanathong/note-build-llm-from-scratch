# Pre-training vs Fine-tuning LLM models

Pre-training and fine-tuning are two critical phases in developing and deploying large language models (LLMs). They enable these models to learn general language patterns and adapt to specific tasks.

* Pre-training: Provides the model with general language knowledge, saving time and resources by reusing this base for multiple applications.
* Fine-tuning: Specializes the model, enabling precise and high-quality performance on specific tasks.

## 1. Pre-Training
This is the initial phase in building an LLM.

### Goal:
* Teach the model general language understanding by **exposing it to a large and diverse corpus of text**.

### How It Works:

* Unsupervised Learning: During pre-training, the model is not given explicit labels but instead learns to predict words, phrases, or structures in text based on context. Common objectives include:
    * Masked Language Modeling (MLM): Predicting missing words in a sentence (e.g., BERT).
    * Causal Language Modeling (CLM): Predicting the next word in a sequence (e.g., GPT).

### Outcome:

* After pre-training, the model becomes a general-purpose language processor. It has learned:
    * Word embeddings (relationships between words).
    * Patterns, syntax, and basic reasoning abilities.
    * Contextual understanding of language.

### Example:
A pre-trained model knows how to form coherent sentences and has broad knowledge but is not tailored for specific tasks like summarization, translation, or sentiment analysis.

## 2. Fine-Tuning
This is the second phase, where the **pre-trained model is adapted for a specific task or domain**.

### Goal:
* Customize the general language model to perform a targeted task effectively.

### How It Works:
* Supervised Learning: The model is trained on labeled datasets relevant to the target task. Examples include:
    * Sentiment analysis: Input text with corresponding labels like "positive" or "negative."
    * Question answering: Input context and questions with corresponding answers.
    * Legal document summarization: Input long documents with summaries as labels.
* Smaller Dataset: Fine-tuning typically uses much smaller, task-specific datasets compared to pre-training.
* Adjusted Weights: The weights learned during pre-training are updated to align the model's output with the target task.

### Outcome:
* The fine-tuned model becomes highly effective for specific tasks, outperforming a purely pre-trained model in those domains.
